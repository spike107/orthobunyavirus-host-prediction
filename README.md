# Orthobunyavirus Host-Prediction Pipeline

> MSc Bioinformatics project — reproducible scripts for building virus host labels, extracting genomic/protein features, and training machine-learning models (Random Forest) under cross-validation and leave-one-virus-out evaluation.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is a **research prototype** accompanying an MSc dissertation.  
It is not production-ready software and should not be used for clinical or public health decision-making.  
Results may vary depending on dataset versions and parameter choices.

## 1. Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of the pipeline described in the dissertation:
- **Phase 1 — Label table construction**: ICTV/DB-based standardisation, evidence-aware relabelling (human vs nonhuman).
- **Phase 2 — FASTA preprocessing**: parse headers, strip version suffixes, build clean IDs, map across nucleotide/CDS/protein sets.
- **Phase 3 — Feature engineering and ML**: nucleotide k-mer (k=2–6), codon usage (RSCU, CAI), protein descriptors (via iFeatureOmegaCLI).  
  Models trained under stratified 80/20 and leave-one-virus-out (LOVO) with group-aware CV parameter tuning.

Key script: `src/pipeline.py` (rename of the dissertation’s `project_pipeline.py`).

## 3. Installation

### Conda (recommended)
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate orthobunya
```

### pip
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### External tools
- [iFeatureOmegaCLI](https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeatureOmega) for protein descriptors.
- UMAP-learn for dimensionality reduction plots.

## 4. Data acquisition

Viral sequences were obtained from the **NCBI Virus portal** (Nucleotide, CDS, and Protein databases), retrieving **all records classified under the *Orthobunyavirus* genus** (NCBI Taxon ID: 11572). No filtering was applied at the download stage; instead, completeness checks and length thresholds (e.g. CDS ≥600 nt for RSCU/CAI) were enforced downstream in the pipeline.  

Raw sequence data are **not included** in this repository due to size and licensing constraints. Users should download the required FASTA files from NCBI and place them under the `data/` directory, following the expected filenames described in the *Inputs* section.  

---

## 5. Inputs

Expected in `data/`:
- `nucleotide.fasta` — nucleotide sequences with pipe-delimited headers.
- `cds.fasta` — CDS records; RSCU/CAI retain `complete_cds`; keep `partial_cds` ≥ 600 nt; filter `unknown` by length.
- `protein.fasta` — protein sequences (prefer those from complete genomes).
- `ictv_species_list.csv` — ICTV species list.
- `ictv_renaming_table.csv` — ICTV old↔new names.
- `virus_hostdb_human.csv` — Virus-Host DB list of human viruses.
- `manual_mapping.csv` — curated mapping.

---

## 6. Usage

### End-to-end
```bash
python -m src.pipeline   --nucleotide data/nucleotide.fasta   --cds data/cds.fasta   --protein data/protein.fasta   --ictv_list data/ictv_species_list.csv   --ictv_rename data/ictv_renaming_table.csv   --vhdb data/virus_hostdb_human.csv   --manual_map data/manual_mapping.csv   --outdir results
```

### Reuse existing results
Set the script to skip computation and only plot from `results/tables/lovo_results.csv`.

### Debug mode (subset run)
Uncomment the sampling *if-block* at lines ~3463–3491 of `src/pipeline.py`.  
This samples **12 human** + **8 nonhuman** species for a quick run (~1.5 h).  
Re-comment the block for full runs.

---

## 7. Outputs

Under `results/`:
- `tables/`: label table, species summary, relabel stats, merged features, train-test and LOVO results, feature-importance summaries.
- `figs/`: performance plots, LOVO boxplots, UMAPs, clustermaps, feature-importance plots.
- `logs/`: runtime logs.
- `pipeline_feature_set_coverage_summary.csv`.

---

## 8. Computational environment and reproducibility

All thresholds (e.g., `min_partial_length = 600 nt`), completeness filters, k-mer sizes, and class-weight options are set via script parameters.  

Analyses were run in:
- Python ≥3.8  
- Biopython ≥1.8  
- pandas ≥1.5  
- scikit-learn ≥1.2  
- matplotlib ≥3.7  
- seaborn ≥0.12  
- umap-learn ≥0.5  
- iFeatureOmegaCLI (current public release).  

Randomised procedures used fixed seeds (42):
- Random Forest (`random_state=42`)  
- Stratified 80/20 split (`random_state=42`)  
- Group-aware 5-fold CV with shuffling (`StratifiedGroupKFold(..., random_state=42)`)  

Intermediate outputs, logs, and provenance files are retained for reproducibility.  
On current hardware, a **full run (136 species)** with group-aware CV required ~13–14 h; the **debug subset (20 species)** ~1.5 h.
